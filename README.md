### Use Case: Central Database for College Contact Information Management

#### **Objective**:
To create a centralized database that stores and manages all contact information for a college, ensuring secure and seamless ingestion of data via APIs and SFTP, automated processing, and efficient storage in an Azure SQL Database.

---

### **Actors**:
1. **College Administrators**: Upload or update contact information via APIs or SFTP.
2. **Integration System**: Handles data ingestion, processing, and storage.
3. **End Users**: Faculty, staff, and students querying contact information.


### **Benefits**:
1. **Centralization**: Consolidates all contact information into a single source of truth.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple data ingestion methods (API and SFTP).
3. **Automation**: Reduces manual effort with automated triggers and workflows.
4. **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle increasing volumes of contact data.
5. **Security**: Ensures secure access to APIs and SFTP endpoints using  API keys 
6. **Real-time Reporting**: Enables real-time updates and analysis of contact information.

```

---

### **Example Scenario**:
1. An administrator uploads a CSV file containing new student contacts via SFTP.
2. Azure Storage triggers an Event Grid notification when the file is uploaded.
3. Event Grid sends a message to the Service Bus queue.
4. The Function App processes the file, validates the data, and inserts it into the SQL Database.
5. Faculty members access the updated contact list via a web portal via and api integrated with the Azure SQL Database.

This solution ensures a robust, scalable, and automated system for managing college contact information effectively.

Set Up Steps 

Creating a serverless API using Azure that leverages Service Bus to communicate with an SQL Database involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of how you can set this up:

1. **Set Up Azure SQL Database**:
   - Create an Azure SQL Database instance.
   - Set up the necessary tables and schemas you'll need for your application.

2. **Create Azure Service Bus**:
   - Set up an Azure Service Bus namespace.
   - Within the namespace, create a queue or topic (based on your requirement).

3. **Deploy Serverless API using Azure Functions**:
   - Create a new Azure Function App.
   - Develop an HTTP-triggered function that will act as your API endpoint.
   - In this function, when data is received, send a message to the Service Bus queue or topic.

4. **Deploy 2 Service Bus Triggered Function**:
   - Create another Azure Function that is triggered by the Service Bus queue or topic.
   - This function will read the message from the Service Bus and process it. The processing might involve parsing the message and inserting the data into the Azure SQL Database.

5. **Deploy a Timer Triggered Function**:
   - Create another Azure Function that is triggered when a file is dropped in a container.
   - This function will stream in a file, read it and place on the service bus topic.

6. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that you have error handling in place. If there's a failure in processing the message and inserting it into the database, you might want to log the error or move the message to a dead-letter queue.

7. **Secure Your Functions**:
   - Ensure that your HTTP-triggered function (API endpoint) is secured, possibly using Azure Active Directory or function keys.

8. **Optimize & Monitor**:
   - Monitor the performance of your functions using Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
   - Optimize the performance, scalability, and cost by adjusting the function's plan (Consumption Plan, Premium Plan, etc.) and tweaking the configurations.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy your functions to the Azure environment. You can use CI/CD pipelines using tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated deployments.

By following these steps, you'll have a serverless API in Azure that uses Service Bus as a mediator to process data and store it in an SQL Database. This architecture ensures decoupling between data ingestion and processing, adding a layer of resilience and scalability to your solution.

  ## Configuration-driven development
 
 "Configuration-driven development," refers to an approach in software development where the behavior and functionality of an application are primarily controlled through configuration files, rather than writing code. It focuses on separating application logic from configuration parameters, allowing developers to easily modify the behavior of the software without the need for extensive code changes.  [Xenhey.BPM.Core.Net6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xenhey.BPM.Core.Net8) offers a orchrestration pipeline using configuration to drive the execution of business logic, providing a tailored solution for each Line Of Business(LOB). The following are some benefits. 

 1. Flexibility: By using configuration files, developers can easily tweak and adjust the application's behavior without modifying the underlying code. It allows for quick customization and adaptation to different scenarios or client requirements.

2. Maintenance: Separating configuration from code simplifies maintenance processes. Updates and modifications can be made by adjusting the configuration files, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality. It also facilitates version control and collaboration, as changes to configuration can be tracked separately from code changes.

3. Scalability: Configuration-driven development promotes scalability by enabling the application to handle different environments, configurations, or user preferences. It allows for seamless deployment across multiple instances or environments with minimal code changes.

4. Testing and Validation: Configuration-driven development enhances testing and validation processes. Since configuration changes are isolated from the codebase, it becomes easier to verify the impact of different configurations on the application's behavior. It also facilitates A/B testing or experimentation by quickly switching between different configurations.

5. Domain-Specific Customization: Configuration-driven development enables domain-specific customization by providing options and settings tailored to specific use cases. This empowers non-technical users or administrators to configure the application according to their specific requirements without the need for coding expertise
